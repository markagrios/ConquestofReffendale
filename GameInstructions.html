<h2><center>General Concept</center></h2>
<p>
This is a turn based strategic empire game. Grow and expand your empire and use resources and gold to conquer your opponent! 
</p>

<br>

<h2><center>Gameplay Mechanics</center></h2>
<p>
During a player's turn, he/she picks a certain action to preform. After the first player's choice has been made, the second player then does the same 
thing. Once both players have made their choices the game will then preform both choices at the same time.
</p>

<br>

<h2><center>Goals</center></h2>
<p>
The player who has conquered the other person's castle wins. On the other hand, once 50 turns have been played and neither castle
has been conquered, the person who has the most amount of territory wins.
</p>

<br>

<h2><center>Starting Off</center></h2>
<p>
When the game starts off, each player gets the same number of points. With these points players have the option to bid a certain number 
of their points without the knowlege of the other player. Whoever bids the most amount of points gets to start first and pick where he/she 
wants his/her castle to be. The player who lost the bid gets second pick of where he/she wants his/her castle to be and starts off second. 
With the remaining points, each player spends points on how much gold and resources they want.
</p>

<br>

<h2><center>Daytime and Nighttime</center></h2>
<p>
During the 'daytime', players choose to complete certain actions that will be generated by the game. After this has been completed, the game will 
then move on to 'nighttime'. During nighttime, the game will display however many gold and resources each player has gained the previous 
'day'. One daytime and nighttime session is considered to be one whole turn. In order to give players time to strategize what actions they would like 
to preform next turn, the total wait time during each nighttime is 15 seconds before moving on to the next daytime. 
<br>
<br>
In addition, a randomly generated event might occur during nighttime that players won't know about till daytime starts. These events
may be good or bad and will affect different parts of the map or the stats of each individual player.
</p>

<br>

<h2><center>Aquiring Territory</center></h2>
<p>
Each player's castle gives an eight-by-eight square of starting territory around the castle. There are two ways in obtaining territory:
<br>
<br>
The first way is to put buildings near the border of the territory. As soon as a player puts a building at the edge of his/her territory, it grows
in a six-by-six radius around the building.
<br>
<br>
The second way is that during every nighttime, each player's 
territory grows by a certain amount depending on how many buildings each player has within his/her territory. The more buildings a 
player has within his/her territory, the more his/her territory will grow at the end of each turn. The direction in which territory grows is completely 
random and each player will not be able to see the growth of his/her territory till daytime. In addition, players are not allowed to place buildings 
outside of their territories. Note that territory will still expand even if a player has no buildings in his/her territory; just at a much slower
rate. Also, certain buildings increase the growth rate of territory more than others. 
</p>

<br>

<h2><center>Aquiring Resources</center></h2>
<p>
Each individual building a player has within his/her territory will generate a certain number of resources each daytime <b>except for towns</b>. 
The amount of resources that a building produces each 'day' is dependent on its base resource yield times the sum of the
resource yield of each individual blocks of terrain that is in the building's 6-by-6 proximity. For example, if a factory is planted within proximity 
of two blocks of forest and two blocks of mountain, that factory will generate a total of 20 resources each 'day' since factories have a base resource 
yield of 5 times the sum of the resource yield of each individual block of mountain and forest. On the other hand, if a city is planted within 
proximity of two blocks of forest and two blocks of mountain, that city will generate a total of 10 resources each 'day' since cities have a base 
resource yield of 2 times the sum of the resource yield of each individual block of mountain and forest. 
</p>

<br>

<h2><center>Aquiring Gold</center></h2>
<p>
Each individual building a player has within his/her territory will generate a certain number of gold each daytime <b>except for factories</b>. 
The amount of gold that a building produces each 'day' is dependent on its base gold yield times the sum of the
gold yield of each individual blocks of terrain that is in the building's 6-by-6 proximity. For example, if a town is planted within proximity of two 
blocks of forest and two blocks of mountain, that town will generate a total of 20 gold each 'day' since towns have a base gold yield of 5 times 
the sum of the gold yield of each individual block of mountain and forest. On the other hand, if a city is planted within proximity of two blocks of 
forest and two blocks of mountain, that city will generate a total of 10 gold each 'day' since cities have a base gold yield of 2 times the sum of the 
gold yield of each individual block of mountain and forest.
